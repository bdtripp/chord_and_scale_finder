# Chord and Scale Finder

The musical chord and scale finder is capable of finding the musical notes that make up the following:
<br/>   
- Major Chord and Scale  
- Minor Chord and Scale  
- Diminished Chord and Scale 
- Augmented Chord and Scale  
<br/> 

 The first inversion and second inversion can also be listed for each of the above chords.

### Output:
<br/>
**Chords** are listed first.
<br/>
-	There will be one line for each type of chord (major, minor, diminished, augmented and the associated inversions).

-	Each line will contain the three musical notes that makeup the chord.

<br/>
-	For the purpose of this run, C will be the only note that displays all the chords, and the inversion types for the major cord.  All other notes will only display major and minor chords.

<br/>
 The major and minor chords will be listed for each musical note (C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, A#/Ab, B). 
<br/>
 Example:
     - C  Major Chords:  C, E, G     
     - C  Minor Chords:  C, D#/Eb, G 
     - C# Major Chords:  C#/Db, F, G#/Ab     
     - C# Minor Chords:  C#/Db, E, G#/Ab 
     - D  Major Chords:  D, F#/Gb, A     
     - D  Minor Chords:  D, F, A 
       etc.
<br/>
**Scales** will be listed next with the same format as the Chords.
<br/>
-	Each line will contain the seven musical notes that makeup the scale.
<br/>
 Example:
      - C  Major Scale:  C, D, E, F, G, A, B 
      - C  Minor Scale:  C, D, D#/Eb, F, G, G#/Ab, A#/Bb 
      - C# Major Scale:  C#/Db, D#/Eb, F, F#/Gb, G#/Ab, A#/Bb, C 
      - C# Minor Scale:  C#/Db, D#/Eb, E, F#/Gb, G#/Ab, A, B    
      - D  Major Scale:  D, E, F#/Gb, G, A, B, C#/Db 
      - D  Minor Scale:  D, E, F, G, A, A#/Bb, C 
        etc.
